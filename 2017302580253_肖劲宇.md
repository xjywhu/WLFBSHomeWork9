a.  
Dx(w) = 2, Dx(y) = 4, Dx(u) = 7   
b.  
if c(x,y) >=1 It will not cause x to inform its neighbors of a new minimum-cost path to u . (detail seen in c.) 
According to the question, all link costs are positive integer values, so we can't change C (x, y) to let x inform neighbors.  

Consider if c(x,w) changes.   
If c(x,w)<=1, then the least-cost path to u continues to pass through w and its cost changes to 5 + c(x,w); x will inform its neighbors
of this new cost.   
If c(x,w) > 6, then the least cost path now passes through y and has cost 11; x will also inform its neighbors of this new cost.   

c.  
The minimum path from x to u is p1 = x->w->u = c(x,w)+c(w,u) = 7.  
another path from x to u is p2 = x->y->u = c(x,y)+c(y,u) = 11.  
if p2 >= p1 the minimum path will not change.  
c(x,y)+c(y,u) >= c(x,w)+c(w,u)
we can get  
c(x,y)>=1.  
It will not cause x to inform its neighbors of a new minimum-cost path to u .
